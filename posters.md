Reconstructing demographic histories from genome sequences is one of the key problems in population genetics. Many analyses use site frequency spectra (SFS) to infer parameters such as the effective population size and population size changes to model historical events. SFS are derived from single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and describe the distribution of genetic variants in a population sample. An extensively used software for demographic inference from SFS is dadi (Diffusion Approximation for Demographic Inference), which applies a diffusion approach to calculate the expected frequency spectrum for different demographic models. The model input parameters then are optimized by maximizing the spectrum similarity to empirical data based on a composite likelihood function. Here, we present an alternative method utilizing a combination of the diffusion approach to generate model spectra and a Bayesian skyline plot to infer a posterior distribution of the demographic history of a population. We simulated SNP data applying coalescent theory and a mutation process to generate SFS for various demographic scenarios and used the produced data to test the method.

Long branch attraction is a well known and problematic artifact in phylogenetic reconstruction. One of the proposed methods to mitigate this issue is to relax the assumption that all sites in the alignment share the same base distribution, and allow for models that can account for structural constraints (ex: CAT, C10-C60, and EDCluster). We have implemented mixture models in RevBayes in a Bayesian framework, and performed a simulation study to analyze the costs and benefits of the models. We find that increasing the number of mixtures produce results with higher log likelihood values, but this effect approaches a limit. We also find that using an excessive number of mixtures does not change the results of the analysis. Our general recommendation from this study is to use mixture models, and to set the number of categories to a generous value (pending hardware and time constraints).

Microsporidia are obligatory intracellular parasites characterized by streamlined genomes. The rapid evolutionary rates of microsporidia, as well as the physiological simplification, made it difficult to position them in the tree of life due to methodological artifacts, such as long-branch attraction. Through phylogenomics it was possible to show that microsporidia are actually derived from very ancestral fungi. Encephalitozoon and Ordospora species are closely related, and their genomes are models for genomic reduction and compaction, as the smallest eukaryotic genome known belongs to Encephalitozoon genus. Here we assembled the genome of new microsporidian species, not yet described and temporarily named FI-F-10, with SPAdes. We obtained an assembled genome size of 2.20 Mb, and protein annotation was performed with Prodigal. A preliminary phylogenomics analysis, with 24 microsporidian lineages, made with RaxML with support statistics of 500 bootstraps replicates positioned FI-F-10 in a basal position in relation to Ordospora colligata clade. We are currently performing a phylogenomics analysis with all microsporidian lineages that have roteomes available in databases, totaling 43 lineages.

African grass rats of the genus Arvicanthis are an important group of rodents of open habitats in sub-Saharan Africa and they are major agricultural pests. This genus is composed of two major groups with different evolutionary histories, but most relationships among species are still not satisfactorily resolved. Until now, the most comprehensive phylogeny was based on mtDNA and six nuclear markers. It was found that the phylogeny of nuclear markers does not correspond to mtDNA phylogeny, this is an indication of reticulate evolution in Ethiopian highlands, similarly as in other montane Ethiopian taxa. The main aims of our study are: (1) to reconstruct the evolutionary history using genomic data and solve the most problematic nodes, especially compared to previous study; (2) to identify the genomic pools (= species delimitation), with the main focus on Ethiopian taxa, where the reticulate evolution is expected; and (3) to resolve taxonomy of problematic groups using integrative approach (genomic species delimitation and geometric morphometry). We already have data from ddRAD sequencing for 117 individuals of genus Arvicanthis with length of 258,170 bp.

The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) has been the most influential climatic warming event of the Cenozoic but its impact on the insect diversification is little known. The main aim of our project is to study the evolutionary response to this event of a mega-diverse insect lineage, the Paederinae rove beetles. Their rich fossil record after PETM could suggest that warming was a driving force for the evolution of this group. To test it, we will build the first largescale phylogeny of Paederinae using morphological data and genomic data of UCEs and use it for exploration of evolutionary patterns. The total-evidence dating approach will be used to jointly estimate phylogenetic relationships and divergence times. Timing the lineage turnover along the tree branches and testing diversification models will allow for assessing the impact of PETM on diversification dynamics of the group and for answering the question if the event is one of the main causes of their current mega-diversity.

Olfactory receptors (ORs) perform a major role in detecting odors, crucial for intra/interspecific communication and species survival. The several ORs classification systems available are full of ambiguities mainly related with existence of a gene repertoire highly diverse and expanded across vertebrate species (the presence of a single intact gene in elephant sharks compared to the more than 1,000 genes in some mammalian species). In fishes, the OR family was characterized in some punctual species but little is known about the gene repertoire in most fishes. The aim was to explore the diversity of OR genes among fish lineages. For that purpose, 37 genomes of jawless and jawed fishes were considered. A gene extraction protocol was applied followed by ML phylogenetic reconstructions. We expected to use new approaches of phylogenetic inference as powerful tools to unravel the ORs classification system and provide an adequate nomenclature since the high diversity of OR gene repertoire across species is a nightmare for traditional phylogenetic inferences methodologies.

Paenibacillus larvae is the causative agent of American foulbrood (AFB), a serious disease of honeybees. Here, 59 P. larvae isolates from Slovenia associated with an extensive AFB outbreak in Slovenia, period 2019–2020, underwent whole-genome sequencing (Illumina). Of these, 40 isolates originated from three apiaries maintained by the same beekeeper. A newly developed cg/wgMLST scheme for P. larvae implemented in BioNumerics software was used for cluster analysis. By combining genetic and epidemiological data, two ST11-ERIC II outbreak clusters were identified on minimum-spanning trees by applying a threshold of 34 wgMLST allele differences (AD) and 24 cgMLST AD. The clusters were separated by a minimum of 51 cgMLST AD and 63 wgMLST AD. Isolates from a single beekeeping practice could be linked by a threshold of 7 cgMLST AD and 11 wgMLST AD. Phylogenetic trees generated by both approaches were generally concordant and provided sufficient discriminatory power to delineate the outbreak clusters. This study improves our understanding of the intra- and inter-outbreak diversity of P. larvae, which is necessary for improving the epidemiological surveillance of AFB.

New World primates (NWPs) are a classic adaptive radiation of >100 living species, derived from an ancestor that reached South America from Africa ~35 million years ago. They are therefore an ideal system for studying the processes and drivers of speciation. However, genomic data for NWPs has been limited to four whole genomes and a few mitochondrial markers. Thus, key aspects of their phylogeny remain unresolved, and it is unclear exactly how many NWP species there are, which impedes conservation efforts. Using a novel genomic dataset from over 200 individual NWPs, including fully assembled mitochondrial genomes, ~3000 UCE loci, and whole genome shotgun sequences, together with revised fossil calibrations, we are producing a comprehensive, dated NWP phylogeny that will be used as a framework for macroevolutionary analyses. We are also implementing coalescence-based identification of species, in order to clarify species boundaries and create a stable list of NWP species.

The project concerns the phylogeny of Paederinae, one of the largest subfamily of r
ove beetles, which includes more than 7,600 species in 225 genera. Despite some recent attempts to shed light on the Paederinae phylogeny, most of the questions of their relationships remain open. At the same time, these few published phylogenetic reconstructions were enough to show how artificial the current classification of the group is. This motivated my PhD advisor to set the aim to build a first genus-level phylogeny of the group using both genomic and morphological data. Genomic data will be generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology targeting the ultraconserved elements (UCEs), while the existing morphological matrix will be expanded with more taxa and characters, including fossils. Then, we will perform a total-evidence analysis using a Bayesian inference method, with a divergence-time estimation as well as Maximum Likelihood analysis to build the phylogeny of the group.


### **10. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of a rapid species radiation: the Andean Lupins**

With over 80 species described and an estimated age of 2 Myr, Andean Lupinus are amongst the fastest species radiations found in plants. To better understand the evolutionary processes driving this rapid species diversification, we are reconstructing the evolutionary history of this clade using genome-wide data obtained using nextRAD sequencing. So far, we have collected and sequenced around 400 specimens representing 75-80 Andean species. We have also assembled a draft genome of one species in this clade, which will allow us to compare sequence-free and sequence-based assembly of RAD loci for phylogenetic reconstructions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of this clade will provide insight into both temporal and geographical patterns of diversification during this rapid radiation; and will allow us to test further hypotheses about the role of demography during rapid diversification.

Conidae is one of the most specious families of marine animals, many of its subgroups having a convoluted taxonomic history and little or no molecular data available. We focus on Cabo Verde archipelago clade of “large-shelled” cones, for which we produced target capture data. We sampled all known geographic and morphological diversity, and individuals were genotyped for 1 mtDNA and 1293 nuclear loci. Species-tree methods that deal with incomplete lineage sorting, such as ASTRAL and revPoMo were applied to populations defined based on SNPs clustering. These resulted in strongly contradicting inferences respect to basal relationships: while an (A, (B, C)) topology is recovered by ASTRAL with several sets of gene trees (the full 1293 loci set and several subsets based on informative sites), revPoMo (applied all positions of the 1293 loci) infers a discordant ((A, B), C) topology. Interestingly, if applied only to the variable positions subset (~17K from ~1M total sites) it infers the same topology as ASTRAL. In all cases inferences are strongly supported. I will present the analyses details and discuss possible reasons for these contradicting inferences.

### **12. Patterns of genomic divergence and phylogenomic analyses in a young marine radiation**

Adaptive radiations are a major source of biodiversity, yet few have been studied in the sea, where barriers to gene flow are less pronounced than on land. Hamlets, a group of Caribbean reef fish that have recently radiated into a brilliant diversity of color patterns, provide an excellent opportunity to investigate a marine radiation from a genomics perspective. Generating and analyzing 170 whole-genome sequences of 13 hamlet species, we found that genetic divergence between species was generally low. In contrast, several narrow genomic intervals harboring genes involved in pigmentation and color vision were characterized by differentiation peaks, underscoring that in hamlets, speciation is driven by natural and sexual selection on color patterns. However, evidence for hybridization and thus ongoing gene flow was found between several species. Preliminary phylogenetic analyses suggest that some species may not be monophyletic, and that some phenotypes may have evolved convergently. However, the combination of low phylogenetic signal, hybridization, and presumably incomplete lineage sorting severely impacted the reliability of the reconstruction. Thus, additional analyses are needed to obtain a more complete picture of the hamlet radiation.

### **13. Congruent birth-death models can be collapsed using Bayesian inference**

The discovery of congruent sets of birth-death processes has raised a series of questions as to what diversification patterns we can infer from phylogenetic trees. Many phylogenetic trees are estimated solely from extant samples and no information about extinction. For such systems, there exists a class of models that are all equally likely, and thus are statistically unidentifiable. However, the general behaviour for such classes is not well known. We simulate a series of phylogenetic trees, both within and across congruence classes, and explore their properties using state of the art Bayesian inference methods. Results show that diversification rates inferred using Bayesian shrinkage priors produce not an arbitrary model from the congruence class. Bayesian shrinkage priors collapses the congruence class to a single, simplest model in accordance with the prior expectations. Thus, diversification rate can be inferred from molecular phylogenies when realistic priors are used.
