# Mathematical, Inferential and Computational Phylogenomics 2021

We are pleased to announce the **Mathematical, Inferential and Computational Phylogenomics** virtual meeting from 15th to 17th February 2021.

The **MIC-Phy** meeting intends to stimulate a broader debate on novel phylogenomic models and methods aiming at reconstructing species trees by considering whole genomes or large fractions of genomes.

We will have two keynote speakers. 

* [Tracy Heath](https://www.eeob.iastate.edu/people/tracy-heath) Iowa State University of Science and Technology, USA<br/>
* To be confirmed 

The keynote talks will describe recent breakthroughs in statistical inference methods and software that address challenges using large and heterogeneous sequence datasets to build species trees.

Alongside invited speakers, contributed talks will be selected from submitted abstracts; these may also describe advances in method development, novel challenges, or discoveries made using new methods.

The meeting includes a workshop entitled **New approaches and methods to phylogeny inference** focusing on the polymorphism-aware phylogeny estimation, including practical exercises based on the software RevBayes and IQ-TREE.
