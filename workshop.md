## Workshop

The meeting includes a workshop entitled 'New approaches to phylogenetic inference' that will run alongside the talks. The workshop consists of three sessions of two hours each and will focus on polymorphism-aware phylogeny estimation, including practical exercises based on the software IQ-TREE and RevBayes.

Registration is now closed!

### Software

Before the course starts, please install the following software on your own computer:

* RevBayes. For this workshop, we will be using the ```development``` RevBayes branch, where the polymorphism-aware models are all available. Make sure you follow these [instructions](revbayes.md) to install RevBayes. 
* [IQ-Tree v2.1.2](http://www.iqtree.org/)
* [Tracer](https://beast.community/tracer)
* [FigTree](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) or [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) with the package **Rcpp**
* A good text editor, such as Sublime Text, NotePad++, Atom, BBEdit, vim, or emacs. Word is not a good text editor!
