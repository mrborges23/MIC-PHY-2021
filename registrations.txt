Sishuo Wang,sishuowang@hotmail.ca,The Chinese University of Hong Kong,3,"Dating Alphaproteobacteria evolution with eukaryotic fossils
Sishuo Wang [1], Haiwei Luo [1]
[1] The Chinese University of Hong Kong
Elucidating the timescale of evolution of bacteria is key to testing hypotheses on their co-evolution with eukaryotic hosts, which, however, is largely limited by the scarcity of bacterial fossils. Here, we incorporate eukaryotic fossils to date the divergence times of Alphaproteobacteria, based on the endosymbiosis theory that mitochondria evolved from an alphaproteobacterial lineage. We estimate that Alphaproteobacteria arose ~1900 million years (Ma) ago, followed by rapid divergence of their major clades. We show that the origin of Rickettsiales, an order of obligate intracellular bacteria whose hosts are mostly animals, predates the emergence of animals for ~700 Ma but coincides with that of eukaryotes. This, together with reconstruction of ancestral hosts, strongly suggests that early Rickettsiales lineages had established previously underappreciated interactions with unicellular eukaryotes. Our mitochondria-based approach displays higher precision and robustness to uncertainties compared with the traditional strategy using cyanobacterial fossils, and suggests that previous applications using divergence times of the modern hosts of symbiotic bacteria to date the bacterial tree of life may need to be revisited.",2,"My name is Sishuo Wang and I am a postdoctoral researcher from Haiwei Luo Lab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am writing to apply for attending the workshop in MIC-Phy 2021.

My research interest is to use phylogenomics and computational approaches to understand the evolutionary history of alphaproteobacterial lineages. I have been studying the lifestyle evolution of Rhizobiales, a group of alphaproteobacteria famous for a high diversity of lifestyle [1]. I applied phylogenomics (IQ-Tree), comparative phylogenetics (BayesTraits), molecular dating (MCMCTree), and comparative genomics approaches to investigate the evolution of host-associated lifestyle in this bacterial order. In another work, I, together with my supervisor, developed a new strategy to date the evolution of alphaproteobacteria, based on the mitochondria endosymbiosis theory, and by doing this we take the advantages of the abundant high-quality eukaryotic fossils to overcome the paucity of bacterial fossils [2]. This work involves large amounts of work in Bayesian divergence time estimation. I am currently working on the evolution of the tolerance to osmotic pressure in roseobacter, a group of generalist bacteria particularly abundant in coastal ecosystems.

Implemented with the idea of making science open, I have uploaded many of my scripts for phylogenetics analysis to the open source depository GitHub (https://github.com/evolbeginner/), some of which have been used by other scientists. Having released three packages (https://rubygems.org/profiles/sishuowang), I am also an active developer of the BioRuby community, the biggest community of bioinformations using Ruby.

Because of the extensive use of phylogenomics analysis in my work, I think the workshop that will be given in MIC-Phy 2021 is a nice opportunity to further my understanding on phylogenomics and molecular evolution.

Many thanks for your consideration!

A major shortcoming of concatenation methods for species tree estimation is their failure to account for incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Coalescent methods explicitly address this problem but make various assumptions that, if violated, can result in worse performance than concatenation. Given the challenges of analyzing DNA sequences, retroelement insertions have emerged as powerful markers for species tree estimation. In this talk, we show that two recently proposed methods, SDPquartets and ASTRAL_BP, are statistically consistent estimators of the species tree under the multispecies coalescent model, with retroelement insertions following a neutral infinite sites model of mutation. We then evaluate the empirical performance of ASTRAL_BP and SDPquartets on retroelement data sets simulated from several model species trees in the anomaly zone. Our results show that ASTRAL_BP and SDPquartets always recover the correct species tree topology on data sets with large numbers of retroelement insertions. Dollo parsimony performed almost as well as ASTRAL_BP and SDPquartets. These three methods outperformed MDC, unordered parsimony, polymorphism parsimony, and Camin-Sokal parsimony. Lastly, we provide an efficient approach for estimating branch lengths in coalescent units with ASTRAL_BP, assuming the expected number of new retroelement insertions per generation is constant across the species tree. For more information, check out our preprint on bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.319038v1).",2,"Dear Organizing Committee:

Benjamin Wölfl [1,2]
[1] University of Vienna Institute of Mathematics, [2] Vienna Graduate School of Population Genetics
I combine efficient backward-time and forward-time simulations of simple to complex evolutionary scenarios in order to describe the terminal branch length distribution of the emerging coalescence trees across all trait contributing loci. In particular, I am interested in the behavior of the distribution under polygenic adaptation. Generally, there is no analytical expression for this distribution which raises the importance of this computational insight. In the next step, this scenario-dependent distribution is used in order to conduct a better performance test of the singleton density score (SDS) in inferring selection. In this way, I want to focus our attention on the characteristics of this distribution, in particular when we are not facing a simple recent hard sweep.",1,"I am not directly working in phylogenomics during my PhD studies, but rather in modeling polygenic adaptation. However, I am currently focusing on this efficient simulation approach (J. Kelleher et al.) to create coalescence trees in arbitrary complex scenarios which may be of interest to some attendees and potentially also have applications in phylogenomics."
Mukta Joshi,Mukta.Joshi@oulu.fi,University of Oulu ,1,,2,"I’m currently a second year PhD student at Ecology and Genetics research unit, University of Oulu, Finland working on phylogenomics of Lepidoptera. 
I first started using phylogenetic methods during my Master’s thesis project at NCBS Bangalore, India where I studied small mammals of western Himalayas. I used genetic as well as morphometric data to identify and delimit the species. I generated molecular data and extensively conducted phylogenetic analyses using Maximum Likelihood (RaxML) and Bayesian approaches (MrBayes). Through this project, I started developing interest in molecular phylogenetic methods and their application in wide range of questions in evolutionary biology. 
After this, I joined Dr. Marko Mutanen’s group at University of Oulu as a doctoral student. My PhD topic revolves around species delimitation of sympatric, parapatric and allopatric species pairs in butterflies using phylogenomics. The case studies chosen for each of this evolutionary scenarios represent examples of long standing taxonomic instabilities. I will be using Target Enrichment as a principle phylogenomic method. As the meeting and the workshop covers topics directly relevant to my PhD project, I hope that attending this workshop will equip me with necessary conceptual basis. I’m currently in the middle of my PhD and always on the lookout for new tools that could be used to analyse my data. Therefore, attending this workshop could prove to be a valuable asset for my doctoral studies.  
Through this online meeting, I’m looking forward to expand my current skill set in phylogenetic comparative methods. I had attended a workshop on RevBayes led by Dr. Tracy Heath and colleagues during International Biogeography meeting in 2017. So, I’m familiar with program to some extent and would like to know more. And as it is the case with every other meeting and conference, a networking opportunities with peers working in the same field is something I’m looking forward to.

I would like to apply for the ‘New approaches to phylogenetic inference’ workshop offered at the Mathematical, Inferential, and Computational Phylogenomics (MIC-Phy) meeting. My main motivation is to improve my skills in phylogenetics and to familiarize myself with the polymorphism-aware phylogenetic models. PoMo seems to be useful for my ongoing project which concerns one of the most diverse groups of animals, Staphylinidae beetles. One of the particularly problematic genera in terms of taxonomy and systematics is the genus Medon that contains not only well-defined species but also species complexes that require careful examination. As far as I understand, PoMo could potentially be used as the main tool to build the species trees of such complexes. Thus, understanding the basics and principles of PoMo methodology should be very useful for me.
Moreover, both RevBayes and IQ-TREE programs are new to me but will be used in my ongoing studies. One of the main aims of my project is to build the first genus-level phylogeny of Staphylinidae based on genomic and morphological data. Therefore, participating in the workshop would be very helpful for me and give me an opportunity to learn the basics of the abovementioned programs.
I hope you will find my application interesting.

My name is Liliana Silva and I am very interested in apply for the ""New approaches to phylogenetic inference"" workshop. 
Actually, I'm a student of doctoral program in Biology at Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto. I am working in chemosensorial perception field, more specifically in genomic evolution of several members of GPCR family, such as ORs and TRs, in metazoans. I perform an in-silico methodology, working exclusively with bioinformatic tools.  One the steps of my protocols is phylogenetic reconstruction. Considering that, I am familiar with basic Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference protocols, and some softwares to perform that like MrBayes and IQtree. 
However, when we are working with complex gene families, with high degree of expansions, some doubts about phylogenetic inference appear. This aspect was one of the main lock points in my doctoral program. I believe I would be a good fit for the workshop since I have the basic concepts of phylogenetic inference and at the same time, a high motivation to learn more and achieve knowledge in this topic.

Yours sincerely,

Liliana Silva

Have a series of questions and doubts for which this workshop comes really handy. Would also love to have a better understanding of these methods, their limitations and their performance at different levels, content which I guess will be part of this workshop, and the opportunity to interact directly with authors, experts and other users is really valuable. 

Also I've never used RevBayes but am quite interested, as maybe I am not an user just because of a lack of total contact with anyone else using it... Although I am familiar with historical biogeographic inference I have never performed it myself, and I am quite unfamiliar with the bulk of more specific concepts behind it, as well as with the software used, and major concerns those analyses can have. I will be having to make a series of these analyses myself very soon (applied to cancer diversification dynamics) and, again, this opportunity comes really handy. Revising major concepts behind divergence-time analyses would also be a plus.

Ivana Jezkova,ijez@uv.es,"University of Valencia, Spain, PhD student",1,,2,"I am a PhD student of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Valencia, Spain. In my PhD project, I am mostly interested in speciation driven by reproductive isolation in a rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. For long time it was believed that due to easy dispersal of this species, different populations are genetically similar and can be considered as one species. However, during last years the deep genetic structure is being found in different population of B. plicatilis around the world and many new species are being described.
The topic of my thesis covers include not only behavioural analysis and different studies at different levels of reproductive isolation. It also includes phylogenetic studies of different genome sites that can potentially play role in reproductive isolation and consequently speciation. I am very interested in broadening this part of my project by studying more deeply the phylogenetic relations among my populations of interest and be able to reconstruct evolutionary history of this group.
I am slowly getting into Bayesian statistics in phylogenesis, however, as I have not that much experience in this topic, there are more and more new questions appearing while I am studying it, than I am able to answer.
I hope that the workshop will help me to develop the phylogenetic part of my current project and I will be able to continue to discover the molecular evolution of the rotifer species, that is due to the life strategies of this species, very interesting.
I hope you will consider my application favourably and I look forward to being part of this very interesting meeting.

Bojan Papic,bojan.papic@vf.uni-lj.si,Dr.,1,,2,"Dear Sir/Madam:

I am a researcher at the Institute of Microbiology and Parasitology, where I am currently mostly working on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data analysis. I completed my PhD thesis entitled 'Characterization and epidemiological investigation of Listeria monocytogenes isolates using next-generation sequencing' in 2020, and in my thesis, I used WGS for outbreak investigation of listeriosis in humans and animals.

I am well familiar with the principles of phylogenetic reconstruction and an experienced user of bioinformatic command-line tools such as RAxML. I am very interested in the field of phylogenomics and thus far, I have mostly generated phylogenetic trees from core genome SNPs using the maximum likelihood approach.

I believe the micphy2020 workshop will advance my knowledge of novel phylogenetic approaches and tools, together with their advantages and caveats. In particular, I am interested in Bayesian inference methods for genome-wide molecular dating, which I have not yet used in practice. I would also like to familiarize myself with recently developed and/or upgraded phylogenetic tools such as IQ-TREE and RevBayes. Currently, I am involved in a research project which includes WGS typing of Paenibacillus larvae, an important honeybee pathogen, for which the evolutionary rate has not yet been established.

Since our institute is involved in research and surveillance of a wide range of zoonotic pathogens, implementation of such advanced phylogenetic tools and approaches would considerably improve the quality of our research projects and pathogen surveillance, leading to improved understanding of the pathogen’s genetic traits, evolution and transmission routes with the aim of  of improving animal and human health.

I already have some experience with RAxML, BEAST and IQTree, but I am eager to expand my skillset with the projects in this new postdoc. The workshop is particularly well suited to my needs because our dataset includes population level sampling for multiple species, which provides opportunities for investigating patterns of incomplete lineage sorting, such as with IQtree-PoMo, and because our project also involves simultaneous analysis of genomic and fossil data, which can be done using the RevBayes package.

I am applying for the workshop on the new approaches to phylogenetic inference, as I hope to obtain new skills in building phylogenetic trees using RevBayes and IQ-TREE.

I am a PhD student working on the project ""Phylogenetic relationships and evolution of Paederinae rove beetles (Staphylinidae) based on genomic and morphological data"", supervised by Dr. Dagmara Żyła (Warsaw, Poland).

The scope of my work is to build the first genus-level phylogeny of my study group based on genomic and morphological data, including also the fossil record. Genomic data will be generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology targeting the regions of ultraconserved elements (UCEs). I plan to use Bayesian Inference approach with simultaneous divergence-time estimation in RevBayes as well as Maximum Likelihood method in IQ-TREE, potentially using PoMo models for the two especially problematic genera of Paederinae rove beetles.

The other part of the project, which I am encouraged to take part in, concerns the estimation of Paederinae diversification dynamics throughout their evolutionary history. Based on the dated phylogeny, we will estimate a set of parameters, such as branch-specific speciation, extinction rates, etc., using different models in RevBayes. That means it will be crucial for me to get some basic knowledge on this software, especially regarding the estimation of the tree and different parameters linked with it.

The project is going to be finished within the next 2.5 years; therefore the new skills that I hope to gain during the workshop will be used by me in the near term."

In the 1960s, several groups of scientists - including Emile Zuckerkandl, Linus Pauling and Allan Wilson - had noted that proteins experience amino acid replacements at a surprisingly consistent rate across very different species. Since the proposal of such a (strict) clock model, a wide range of different clock model parameterizations have emerged which now take up a prominent place in the field of phylogenetic inference as well as in many other areas of evolutionary biology. In studying pathogen evolution, molecular clocks allow combining the genetic differences between samples and their collection times to estimate time-calibrated phylogenies. Along with the development of increasingly complex clock models comes the need to accurately determine which model is best suited to analyse a particular data set. For this purpose, different marginal likelihood estimators have been developed in recent years to estimate relative model fit in a Bayesian framework. These estimators have shown considerable improvement in accuracy, but often at the expense of an increased computational cost. In our simulation study, we examine the performance of these estimators in identifying the correct underlying clock model. The performance of these estimators is also tested in a scenario where they are faced with overparameterization using the clock models. Finally, we evaluate their performance on various empirical data sets, including various pathogen and yeast examples.

In evolutionary genomics, it is fundamentally important to understand how characteristics of genomic sequences, such as the expression level of a gene, determine the rate of adaptive evolution. While numerous statistical methods, such as the McDonald-Kreitman test, are available to examine the association between genomic features and positive selection, we currently lack a statistical approach to disentangle the direct effects of genomic features from the indirect effects mediated by confounding factors. To address this problem, we present a novel statistical model, the MK regression, which augments the McDonald-Kreitman test with a generalized linear model. Analogous to the classic multiple regression model, the MK regression can analyze multiple genomic features simultaneously to distinguish between direct and indirect effects on positive selection. Using the MK regression, we identify numerous genomic features responsible for positive selection in chimpanzees, including local mutation rate, residue exposure level, gene expression level, tissue specificity, and metabolic genes. In particular, we show that highly expressed genes have a higher rate of adaptation than their weakly expressed counterparts, even though a higher expression level may impose stronger negative selection on protein sequences. Also, we observe that metabolic genes tend to have a higher rate of adaptation than their non-metabolic counterparts, possibly due to recent changes in diet in primate evolution. Overall, the MK regression is a powerful approach to elucidate the genomic basis of adaptation.",1,

Giorgio Bianchini [1], Patricia Sánchez-Baracaldo [1]
[1] School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK
Trait evolution analyses enable the comparison of characters amongst different species — a useful technique when inferring ancestral phenotypes based on a phylogeny of living taxa. The evolution of discrete characters can be mapped on the branches of a phylogenetic tree using stochastic mapping. I would like to present sMap, a new program to perform stochastic mapping analyses.
Key features characterising sMap are: a wide variety of models and prior distributions; the ability to use a posterior distribution of trees and to compute marginal likelihoods to perform model selection analyses; and the implementation of three kinds of characters: ‘independent’ characters, which do not interact with each other; ‘dependent’ characters, which co-evolve at the same time; and ‘conditioned’ characters, whose state is determined by the state of other characters.
Conditioned characters, in particular, are a completely novel feature; they make it possible to model the effects on a single complex phenotype of the interaction of multiple simple characters.
sMap can produce robust results and answer new kinds of questions. It is freely available and distributed under a GPL licence, in a command-line and Graphical User Interface version; a detailed user manual with examples and tutorials is also provided.
The wide variety of algorithms implemented in sMap enables accurate analyses of the evolution of discrete characters. As a multiplatform and open-source project, sMap can be used on a variety of systems and situations, such as academic research and teaching.",1,

Spyros Lytras[1], Joseph Hughes[1]
[1: MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, Scotland, UK]
Distinct patterns of dinucleotide representation, such as CpG and UpA suppression, are characteristic of certain viral genomes. Recent research has uncovered vertebrate immune mechanisms that select against specific dinucleotides in targeted viruses. This evidence highlights the importance of systematically examining the dinucleotide composition of viral genomes. We have developed a novel metric, called corrected synonymous dinucleotide usage (SDUc), for quantifying dinucleotide representation in coding sequences. Our method compares the observed abundance of a given dinucleotide combination to that expected based on the sequence’s single nucleotide composition, while also accounting for amino acid composition. We present a Python3 package, DinuQ, for calculating SDUc and other relevant metrics for exploring dinucleotide and codon biases. The package allows for various parameterisations of the SDUc metric and a method for determining error around the results. We apply our method on a set of Sarbecoviruses to show that the phylogenetic clade SARS-CoV-2 belongs to is associated with an adaptive reduction in the CpG composition of their genomes. We further show how CpG composition is clearly reflective of recombination patterns in these coronaviruses.",2,"I am a second year PhD candidate at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research. My work involves studying genomic signatures of host-driven viral evolution, focusing on how antiviral mechanisms impose selective pressures on the protein level and the nucleotide composition of viral genomes. 
I possess a good skillset of performing phylogenetic and selection analyses through my PhD studies so far and my BSc in Evolutionary Biology at the University of Edinburgh. Yet, as my research progressively involves tackling more complex scientific questions, I strive to acquire a better understanding of the mathematical framework behind the methods I am using. Attending the MIC-Phy 2021 workshops seems like the perfect opportunity to both improve my methodological skillset and start delving more into the foundations of these methods.
The application of Bayesian statistics on phylogenetic inferences is a field I am very interested in exploring further and the focus of this year’s workshop on Bayesian methods makes it even more relevant to the training I am trying to gain. I will be pursuing more courses on the field later in the year, so the MIC-Phy workshops should prove to be a very good steppingstone for these. 
The RevBayes session is the one I am looking forward to attending the most, since it is a framework I have been wanting to incorporate into my research for a while now but has proved challenging without any training on it. Dr Hohna’s tutorial should be a great introduction to the method that will allow me to pursue its use in my projects. One project I am now trying to launch involves describing my own substitution models that formally account for dinucleotide biases in virus genomes. RevBayes should be an excellent tool for making the models and incorporating them into phylogenetic inferences. 
For these reasons I think that this workshop will prove vital to my academic development and I would be grateful if you considered my attendance."

As a model system, our lab uses hamlets, a group Caribbean reef fishes that have radiated into a brilliant diversity of color patterns. Population genomic analyses of more than 300 genomes from 18 species have revealed so far that the radiation is very young (significantly less than 100,000 years), and represents a spectrum from barely to moderately differentiated species in the early phases of speciation. However, except for several narrow genomic intervals that harbor genes involved in pigmentation and color vision, divergence between all species remain generally low across the genome. In order to more accurately characterize and date the radiation, as well as studying whether convergent evolution has occurred, I would like to perform a thorough analysis of the phylogenetic relationships between the populations and species. So far, my efforts have been confounded by a combination of low phylogenetic signal, incomplete lineage sorting, and ongoing gene flow. Through the workshop, I am hoping to learn how to overcome some of these challenges by applying polymorphism-aware models. Given the size of the dataset and the computational burden it incurs, I am also excited that such models promise not to increase runtime, which would make it possible to harness the full potential of our comprehensive dataset.

Jamie R. Oaks [1] and Perry L. Wood Jr. [1]

[1] Department of Biological Sciences & Museum of Natural History, Auburn University, Auburn, Alabama 36849

Over the past two decades, much progress has been made in developing phylogenetic methods for estimating rooted, time-proportional trees. However, all of these methods assume that processes of diversification affect evolutionary lineages independently; i.e., divergence times are independent conditional on the topology. This assumption is likely violated in nature by processes that cause multiple lineages to diverge. Such processes are potentially common in biogeography, epidemiology, and genome evolution. We introduce a general Bayesian framework to relax the assumption of independent divergences during phylogenetic inference and test hypotheses about processes of diversification that affect multiple evolutionary lineages. Using simulations, we find that the new method accurately infers shared divergence events when they occur, and performs as well as current methods when divergences are independent. We apply our new approach to genomic data from geckos from the Philippines to test the hypothesis that interglacial rises in sea level caused bursts of speciation across the islands.

Weixuan Ning [1], Heidi Meudt [2], Jennifer Tate [1]
[1 School of Fundamental Sciences, Massey University], [2 Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, New Zealand]
When using high copy nuclear gene markers such as ITS (internal transcribed spacer, nuclear ribosomal DNA, nrDNA) or plastid regions, phylogenetic inference of closely related plant species with reticulate evolutionary histories are challenging. This is because ITS can be subjected to concerted evolution and commonly used plastid markers have few informative sites. Newer approaches use target enrichment sequencing of low/single copy nuclear genes (LCNG) by the universal Angiosperm353 bait set, and this provides a way to capture all copies of the desired genes at low costs. This approach can be particular useful to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of genera that contain many closely related polyploids. Many New Zealand genera have a complex evolutionary history involving polyploidy. For example, the current sections Schizeilema and Stilbocarpa of the genus Azorella comprise a subalpine lineage of 17 species in New Zealand (16 species) and Australia (1 species) whose ploidal levels may be 4x, 6x or 10x. Unpublished ITS and plastid phylogenetic trees offer low resolution of New Zealand Azorella species relationships, and suggest that they originated from diploid Azorella species in Chile and Argentina. New phylogenomic data is being generated from low/single copy nuclear genes using the Angiosperm353 bait set. By analyzing data from the Angiosperm353 markers, we aim to 1) setup the pipelines to extract the multiple copies of the targeted genes, which is the critical step yet to be solved; 2) interpret the origins of the polyploid species from the extracted homoeologous sequences; and 3) understand the biogeographic history of Azorella sections Schizeilema and Stilbocarpa. 
 
",2,"Dear Sir/Madam,
My name is Weixuan Ning, and I am a PhD student in Massey University, New Zealand. I am thrilled to see MIC-Phy 2021 is offering a virtual workshop opportunity regarding the ‘New approaches to phylogenetic inference’. With this letter of motivation, I would like to show my interest of participating in the workshop. 
The theme and the content of the workshop is perfectly fits my research questions. Currently, using the universal targeted baits to capture the low copy nuclear genes is one of the most economical and informative approaches to resolve plant phylogenetic relationships. My project is attempting to advance the phylogenetic tree reconstructions using the heterogeneous sequences, or the paralogs, of the closely related polyploids. In addition, we are also going to test the limitations of low copy nuclear genes on showing the population variations. However, the identification and separation of paralog sequences from ortholog sequences remain the main issue to solve. 
I believe this workshop would offer me insight into the theoretical and practical knowledge of the phylogenetic inference. It can be an inspiration of my own project to improve the experimental design and the pipeline constructions. 
Many thanks for your consideration and looking forward to hearing from you.
Regards,
Weixuan

While many methods to identify lateral gene transfers exist, I am primarily using gene tree inference and analysis. Hence, optimizing the quality of my individual gene trees via various means is key to my project, since it will yield more accurately detected lateral gene transfer events. Specifically, genes that are laterally transfered might be subject to different evolutionary constraints in the 'donor' and 'acceptor' lineages, hence we might well expect these sequences to be heterogeneous. Maybe even more of relevance to this workshop is the need to have a high-quality species tree in order to be able to interpret the single gene trees. Given this need, my project also involves constructing a species tree, particularly to place species whose position is yet uncertain, for example because they might be strongly diverged. Given that such lineages (for example strongly reduced parasites) might also present interesting candidates for holding laterally transferred genes, their placement will be crucial. Altogether, due to my main research project as well as my general interest I am eager to increase my knowledge on phylogenetic inference methods. "

Reconstructing demographic histories from genome sequences is one of the key problems in population genetics. Many analyses use site frequency spectra (SFS) to infer parameters such as the effective population size and population size changes to model historical events. SFS are derived from single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and describe the distribution of genetic variants in a population sample. An extensively used software for demographic inference from SFS is dadi (Diffusion Approximation for Demographic Inference), which applies a diffusion approach to calculate the expected frequency spectrum for different demographic models. The model input parameters then are optimized by maximizing the spectrum similarity to empirical data based on a composite likelihood function. Here, we present an alternative method utilizing a combination of the diffusion approach to generate model spectra and a Bayesian skyline plot to infer a posterior distribution of the demographic history of a population. We simulated SNP data applying coalescent theory and a mutation process to generate SFS for various demographic scenarios and used the produced data to test the method.",2,"I am a PhD student at the beginning of the second year of my doctorate, currently developing software for demographic inference from SNP data. Right now, I use site frequency spectra as input and combine diffusion approximation and a Bayesian analysis to infer population size changes through time. In the future, I hope to extend the software to species delimitation, presumably based on the multispecies coalescent. Thus, I am extremely interested in learning about existing approaches and their underlying theory for inferring trees and variation on the population and the species level. The polymorphism-aware phylogenetic models seem to be an exciting way of estimating species trees while accounting for the diversity within populations, hence I am keen on getting to know their theoretical background while trying a hands-on application example. Additionally, I think it is useful to exchange experiences and opinions with both developers and users on how to proceed with such an inference and which aspects of the software might be especially important when implementing it."

Two recent high profile studies have attempted to use edge (branch) length ratios from large sets of phylogenetic trees to determine the relative ages of genes of different origins in the evolution of eukaryotic cells. This approach can be straightforwardly justified if substitution rates are constant over the tree for a given protein. However, such strict molecular clock assumptions are not expected to hold on the billion-year timescale. I will discuss an alternative set of conditions under which comparisons of edge length distributions from multiple groups of phylogenies of proteins with different origins can be validly used to discern the order of their origins. Then I will show that functional divergence in proteins adapting to new cellular roles during the prokaryote-eukaryote transition has differentially affected edge length distributions of genes of different origins, complicating attempts to order the events that occurred during eukaryogenesis.",1,

Bjørn Tore Kopperud [1]
[GeoBio-Center, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, 80333 Munich, Germany]
The recent discovery of congruent sets of phylogenetic birth-death processes has raised a series of questions as to what diversification patterns we can infer from phylogenetic trees. Many phylogenetic trees are estimated solely from extant samples, and it is common to estimate ultrametric trees without any extinction events. The absence of extinction events or other information about the tempo of diversification rates makes models in the same congruence class statistically unidentifiable. However, the general behaviour for such classes is not well known. How similar are these classes? Are they easy to construct, and is it possible to mimic plausible diversification histories within one single class? To answer this, we simulate a series of phylogenetic trees, both within and across congruence classes, and investigate their properties using state of the art Bayesian inference methods. Our results show that the diversification rates inferred using Bayesian shrinkage priors produce not an arbitrary model from the congruence class. Instead, using Bayesian shrinkage priors collapses the congruence class, yielding a single, simplest model in accordance with the prior expectations. Thus, diversification rate can be inferred from standard phylogenies when realistic priors are used.",2,"Dear committee,

I am interested in participating in the meeting primarily because I am interested in phylogenetics and related topics. More specifically, I am a PhD student with Sebastian Höhna at the LMU-Munich, one of the main RevBayes developers. Aside phylogenetics and tree estimation, I am also interested in learning how a RevBayes workshop is taught, how people outside my lab use it, and what questions or struggles people usually have. I remember listening to a talk by Ziheng Yang on tree inference based on the multispecies coalescence model in the ESEB 2017 conference. Even though I didn't understand much at the time, and despite tree inference not being my primary study focus, it was and is very interesting to see the new developments in phylogenetic methods and how they are applied using newer genomic-scale data. I am hoping that there are some participants that are interested in my work on identifiability in diversification rate estimation, and that I can practice how to narrate my study project for a wider audience than just my own lab.
