## Workshop

The meeting includes a workshop entitled 'New approaches to phylogenetic inference' that will run alongside the talks. The workshop consists of three sessions of two hours each and will focus on polymorphism-aware phylogeny estimation, including practical exercises based on the software IQ-TREE and RevBayes.

The workshop is free but the number of participants is limited. Students and researchers are invited to apply by submitting a motivation letter [&#8599;Registration](registration.md).
